# cardano-cross-router

Cardano cross router service to support crosschain to Cardano policy.

## Code Structure

-   contract-cross
    -   crosschain contract for Cardano and EVM.
-   contract-router
    -   router contract for Cardano.
-   router-agent
    -   router agent service to invoke Cardano transactions for router contract.

## How to use

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (latest stable version recommended)
-   [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
-   [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### Deploy locally

1. Install dependencies:

    ```sh
    pnpm install
    ```

2. Build the project:

    ```sh
    pnpm run build
    ```

3. Run the project:

    ```sh
    pnpm start
    ```

4. Adjust `pollingInterval` in both `src/router-in/minswap/config.ts` and
   `src/router-out/config.ts` as desired (only applies to the `monitor` endpoint
   and determines how often each of the scripts are queried)

5. Currently this application uses a combination of Blockfrost and Kupmios,
   therefore you'll need to set 4 environment variables:

```sh
export SEED_PHRASE="agent's wallet seed phrase"

export BLOCKFROST_KEY="blockfrost api key"

export KUPO_URL="authenticated kupo instance url"

export OGMIOS_URL="authenticated ogmios instance url"
```

5. Available commands are:

-   For monitoring the contracts and routing incoming requests, use one of
    these two commands:

```sh
# For Minswap V2 RouterIn instance to Minswap:
node dist/minswap-cli.js Preprod Single monitor

# For RouterOut to Treasury:
node dist/router-out-cli.js Preprod Single monitor
```

-   For reclaiming an order Minswap V2 instance of RouterIn, use:

```sh
node dist/minswap-cli.js Preprod Single monitor --reclaim
```

-   For cancelling an order stuck at Minswap V2, use this command:

```sh
node dist/minswap-cli.js Preprod Single cancel-one-order
```

-   If the canceller script is not registered, register it with `register-canceller-validator`:

```sh
node dist/minswap-cli.js Preprod Single register-canceller-validator
```

-   Get command line guide for submitting a swap request with `-h`:

```sh
node dist/minswap-cli.js Preprod Single submit-advanced -h
```

Note the minimum Lovelace count for each request is `4000000` (4₳) plus the
maximum between `router-fee` and `reclaim-router-fee`, plus `routerOutRouterFee` specified
in the `extra-config` JSON file (which is the router agent's fee for carrying
out the transaction from RouterOut to treasury).

So for example, with a `router-fee` of 2₳, and a `reclaim-router-fee` of 1₳, and
also a `routerOutRouterFee` of 1₳, the minimum required ADA will be 7₳.

The `--owner` must also always be set to the treasury's address in order to
allow it reclaim an order at RouterIn.

    ```sh
    docker exec -it router-agent-playground /bin/sh

    ...

    /usr/src/app $ node dist/minswap-cli.js Preprod Single submit-advanced ...
    ```

6. Stop the Docker container:

    ```sh
    make docker-down
    ```

## Sample Transactions – `FreeUSD` to `FreeBTC`
