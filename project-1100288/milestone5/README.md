# Milestone 5

For the Final Milestone, the acceptance criteria required that a transaction on an EVM chain can trigger a Smart Beacon Script on Cardano, which then executes an asset swap on a DEX on Cardano, which then triggers a cross-chain transaction to bridge the traded-for asset from Cardano to the user’s wallet address on an EVM chain. Also required:

1.	A final report.
2.	A video demonstration.
3.	A publicly available demo.

## Final thoughts/comments:

  - The Wanchain team has successfully demonstrated that a transaction on an EVM chain can trigger a Smart Beacon Script on Cardano, which then executes an asset swap on a DEX on Cardano, which then triggers a cross-chain transaction to bridge the traded-for asset from Cardano to the user’s wallet address on an EVM chain. This is a true cross-chain application. However, despite this approach being technically functional, there are non-negligible scalability issues. Notably, each specific use case requires configuration of smart router scripts. So, while the outcome of this project is fully delivered and represents a technical achievement, it is better cast as a MVP rather than a production-ready tool. True cross-chain applications would be better serviced by a full cross-chain data transfer/message passing protocol.
