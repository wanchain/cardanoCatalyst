# Milestone 5

For the Final Milestone, the acceptance criteria required that a transaction on an EVM chain can trigger a Smart Beacon Script on Cardano, which then executes an asset swap on a DEX on Cardano, which then triggers a cross-chain transaction to bridge the traded-for asset from Cardano to the user’s wallet address on an EVM chain. Also required:

1.	A final report.
2.	A video demonstration.
3.	A publicly available demo.

### Next steps for the product or service developed

* Interested projects/DAPPs can now develop customised Smart Routers that can interact with Wanchain’s cross-chain technology to implement seamless cross-chain features and interactions. The Wanchain team will provide technical support, as needed.

## Final thoughts/comments:

  - We have successfully demonstrated that a transaction on an EVM chain can trigger a Smart Beacon Script on Cardano, which then executes an asset swap on a DEX on Cardano, which then triggers a cross-chain transaction to bridge the traded-for asset from Cardano to the user’s wallet address on an EVM chain. This is, functionally, a true cross-chain application. This tool, as provided, can be used to interact with any Cardano Dapp directly from an EVM wallet, including Metamask. The Wanchain team will assist any applications that would like to use this tool in their existing DAPP to target users on EVM chains directly.
